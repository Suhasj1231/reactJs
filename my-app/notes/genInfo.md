# ðŸ“˜ React Components â€“ Complete Guide

## ðŸ”¹ What are React Components?

React components are **reusable, self-contained blocks of code** that return React elements (JSX) to render UI.

There are two main types:
- **Function Components** (modern, preferred)
- **Class Components** (older, still used in legacy apps)

---

## ðŸ§© Why Use Components?

- Break down UI into manageable, reusable pieces
- Easier to **test**, **maintain**, and **scale**
- Supports **props**, **state**, **lifecycle methods**, and **hooks**

ðŸ“› Naming Conventions
Element	Convention
Component Name	PascalCase (e.g., MyComponent)
File Name	Match component name (e.g., MyComponent.jsx)
Folder Structure	Often grouped by feature or domain
Props	Use camelCase (e.g., userName)

âœ… React treats components starting with a capital letter as custom elements.

---
# exporting multiple component from a single file 
Concept	Detail
export const	Use this for each named export
No default export	You don't usually mix export default with named exports in 1 file
Import using {}	Use destructuring ({ ComponentName }) to import
Good for related components	Group small, related components in one file (e.g., Button variations)

# ðŸ“˜ All About JSX in React

---

## ðŸ§¾ What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe the UI structure.  
It allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
It looks like HTML but is transpiled into React.createElement() calls behind the scenes.


## âœ… JSX Rules & Syntax
1. Only one parent element

2. Use className instead of class

3. Use htmlFor instead of for

4. JSX accepts expressions inside {}

5. Self-closing tags must end with /

6. Props are passed as attributes

7. JSX must be wrapped inside parentheses if multiline

## Props : 
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs to React components. They allow data to flow from parent to child components.


| Feature   | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only | Cannot be modified by the child component     |
| One-way   | Flow from **parent to child** only            |
| Dynamic   | Values can change based on parent state/logic |
| Reusable  | Make components configurable and flexible     |




| Best Practice                | Why?                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Use destructuring            | Improves readability             |
| Donâ€™t mutate props           | They are immutable inputs        |
| Name props clearly           | Improves component clarity       |
| Validate props (optional)    | Catch bugs early using PropTypes |
| Use default values           | Prevent undefined values         |
| Use children prop            | For nested components            |
| Use spread for flexible APIs | For passing rest of props        |


## ðŸ”’ Why Are Props Read-Only in React?
Props in React are read-only by design because they are meant to be inputs from the parent component to the child component. This enforces one-way data flow, which is a core principle in React architecture.

## ðŸ“¦ How Are Props Read-Only?
When a component receives props, React internally freezes them so that they can't be mutated directly. If you try to do so, React will not throw an error immediately (in JavaScript), but it will lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

## | Reason                | Benefit                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Predictable data flow | Easier to debug and trace                           |
| One-way binding       | Encourages clean, modular components                |
| Reusability           | Child doesnâ€™t depend on internal changes            |
| Performance           | Optimizations like memoization rely on immutability |


## children prop : 
In React, props.children is a special prop automatically passed to every component. It represents the content that is wrapped inside the component's opening and closing tags.

| Use Case            | Example                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Custom Layout       | Wrap content inside cards, modals, sections     |
| Reusable Containers | For wrappers like `<Layout>`, `<ThemeProvider>` |
| Composition         | Pass components or JSX as children              |


| Feature          | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `props.children` | Special prop containing inner content                   |
| Flexible         | Can hold JSX, strings, arrays, or functions             |
| Use Cases        | Modals, Cards, Layouts, Reusable containers             |
| Best Practice    | Render children inside wrappers to maximize reusability |
