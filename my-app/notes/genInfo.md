## 1️⃣ What Are Hooks?
Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
They make React components simpler, more reusable, and cleaner.

Before Hooks:
We needed class components for state, lifecycle methods, and refs.

After Hooks:
We can do everything in functional components.



## What is useState?
A React Hook for managing state inside functional components.

It lets you store data that changes over time and re-render the component when that data changes.
