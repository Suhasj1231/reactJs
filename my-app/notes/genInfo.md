## Conditional rendering
Conditional rendering in React means showing or hiding parts of the UI based on a condition (like if/else, ternary, or logical operators). It allows your app to dynamically respond to state, props, or other variables.


| Syntax         | Example                                       |    |                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `if` statement | For more complex conditions                   |    |                                              |
| Ternary `? :`  | For inline conditional rendering              |    |                                              |
| Logical `&&`   | For simple conditions (if true, show element) |    |                                              |


## ðŸ“Œ Gotchas / Best Practices
Avoid putting full if/else statements inside JSX (use them before return).

Ternaries are great, but don't nest them deeply.

Prefer && when only rendering something if a condition is true.

Use helper functions if logic gets complex.


##  List rendering
List rendering in React means displaying a list of elements dynamically based on an array of data. This is commonly done using .map() to loop over the array and generate a component or JSX for each item


## Why .map()?
React doesn't have a built-in loop like for or while inside JSX. So, we use JavaScriptâ€™s .map() to:
Traverse the array
Return JSX for each item
Render all of them in the U

##  The key Prop
Required by React to keep track of each item in the DOM.
Should be unique and stable (e.g., id or index as fallback).
Helps in optimizing rendering performance.


## note
| Tip                                          | Why                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Use a **unique key** like `id`               | Prevents rendering issues                       |
| Avoid using **index as key** (unless static) | Leads to bugs when array is re-ordered          |
| Keep **map return concise**                  | Use fragments or component extraction if needed |



## DOM (Document Object Model)
ðŸ“Œ What is DOM?
The DOM is a programmatic representation of an HTML document. It represents the structure of your webpage as a tree of nodes (elements, attributes, text, etc.).

Document
 â””â”€â”€ <html>
      â””â”€â”€ <body>
           â””â”€â”€ <div id="root">
                â”œâ”€â”€ <h1>Hello</h1>
                â””â”€â”€ <p>World</p>




## ðŸªž Virtual DOM
ðŸ“Œ What is Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of the real DOM, used by libraries like React to optimize updates.

Instead of updating the real DOM directly (which is slow), React:

Builds a Virtual DOM version of the UI.

When state/props change, it creates a new Virtual DOM tree.

Compares the new tree with the previous one (diffing).

Calculates the minimal set of changes.

Updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.

ðŸ”„ This is known as Reconciliation.





| Feature              | DOM                        | Virtual DOM                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Speed                | Slower                     | Faster due to batching and diffing  |
| Update               | Direct                     | Abstracted and optimized            |
| Rerender performance | Full updates               | Only diffs are updated              |
| Code simplicity      | Manual DOM handling needed | React handles updates declaratively |
