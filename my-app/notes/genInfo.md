## React.memo

A higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes a component.

Prevents re-rendering if the props havenâ€™t changed.

Itâ€™s a pure component optimization.



## useMemo

A hook that memoizes the result of a function (value).

Used to cache expensive calculations so they donâ€™t run on every render.



## useCallback

A hook that memoizes a function definition.

Useful when passing functions as props to child components (to prevent unnecessary re-renders).


## Use Cases
âœ… React.memo

When you want to avoid re-rendering of a pure child component that only depends on props.

Good for static props or rarely changing props.

âœ… useMemo

When you have expensive computations (e.g., filtering a large list, doing math, generating derived data).

Use it to cache computed values.

âœ… useCallback

When passing functions as props to memoized children (React.memo) to prevent unnecessary renders.

Also useful for dependency arrays (e.g., useEffect).

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

Donâ€™t overuse â€” these tools add complexity and memory overhead.

Use them only when performance problems appear.

For simple values/functions, skip them.

Use useMemo for values

Example: const filteredList = useMemo(() => items.filter(...), [items])

Use useCallback for functions

Example: const handleClick = useCallback(() => {...}, [dependency])

Wrap components in React.memo when:

The component is re-rendering often.

The props rarely change.
