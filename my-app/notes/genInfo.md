ðŸ”¹ What is useRef?

useRef is a React hook that gives you a mutable container whose .current property persists across renders.

Unlike useState, changing a ref does not cause a re-render.

It is commonly used for:

Accessing/manipulating DOM elements (instead of document.querySelector).

Storing mutable values that donâ€™t need to trigger a re-render.

Persisting values between renders (like previous state, timers, counters, etc.).
